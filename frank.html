                            <h6>Environmental Impact & Risk Management Consultant, Environmental Media Analyst</h6>
                             <br></br>
                            <p class="project-description"style="font-size:120%;color:black;text-align:justify"> Dr. Frank Anim has diverse academic backgrounds. He holds a Diploma in Education and a BSc in Zoology & Botany from the University of Cape Coast, Ghana; an MPhil in Environmental Science from the University of Ghana; and a PhD in Geology (Environmental/Contaminant Hydrology) from the Department of Earth Science (formerly Geology Department), University of Ghana, in collaboration with the University of Copenhagen‚ÄêDenmark, under the DANIDA-ENRECA Hydrogeological Project.  In addition, Dr. Anim has certificates in Water Quality Monitoring and Ground and Surface Water Hydrology from the Cranfield University in England. He has had additional training in IFC Performance Standards jointly organised by IFC and Institute of Environmental Studies in Ghana and Hydrochemical Modelling from University of Copenhagen which was taken as part of his PhD program.
<br>Professionally, Dr. Anim is an Environmental and Social Impact and Risk Management Consultant and Environmental Media Analyst. He has over 20 years postgraduate experience, 17 years of which are related to his current career. Frank has been involved in a lot of assignments, both Greenfield and Brownfield Projects in his home country and within the sub-region. He is a member of the International Association of Impact Assessors (IAIA), Ghana with registration no IAIA-Gh031. His ability to apply various computer software in a complementary manner to any set of data provides him with a better understanding in analysing and interpreting data with appropriate recommendations and cogent alternatives. Frank has undertaken over sixty (60) consultancy assignments in his field, most of them as the Lead Consultant; and has pioneered and/or in collaboration with other Experts have developed cutting edge tools for environmental and safety management assessment. For instance, he was key in designing tools for the Knowledge and Review (KaR) study for Small Scale Private Sector Participation in Rural Water Supply jointly undertaken by DFID, Water Resources Management, UK, Water Aid and Community Water and Sanitation Agency (CWSA) for the Ghana team. He was also part of the team that developed the criteria for assessing the Environmental Performance Rating and Public Disclosure (EPRPD) for the mining sector in Ghana in 2005, which has become the benchmark for the Ghanaian Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in assessing the environmental compliance of the mining industry, now known as the Akoben Ratings. He also played a leading role in developing a Compensation Policy and Monitoring Framework for the mining sector in Ghana in 2009 under the NREG Project. He also developed a format for auditing environmental, social, health and safety impact for the Small-Town Water Supply and Sanitation Project in Ghana in 2008. In addition, since most assignments Frank had been involved were donor-funded, he works to meet international standards such as IFC Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability, World Banks Environmental and Social Standards, African Development Bank Group‚Äôs Integrated Safeguard System, The Equator Principles and other international conventions and protocols on environmental and social sustainability. His wide range of consultancy assignments in Environmental and Social Impacts and Risks Management, Environmental and Social Due Diligence Assessment, Anthropogenic Impact on ground and surface water resources, Environmental Media Quality Monitoring and Analysis, Resettlement Action Plans-RAPs among others, altogether have endowed him with a deeper knowledge on issues involving the environment and society. His professional life, which has also been in close association with most rural, and farming communities and those in the low-income brackets makes him readily accepted even in the most hostile environment. Frank, undoubtedly, interacts well with people, irrespective of social, academic, political and religious backgrounds with the sole aim of achieving the best results for any assigned task. His diverse academic backgrounds, as a professional trained teacher, a biologist, environmental scientist and contaminant hydrologist, afford him unusual strength, especially in the most difficult and nerve-wracking situation and easily comes out with cutting edge, workable and acceptable solutions and/or alternatives. Currently, Dr. Anim is the Head of NEMAS Consult Limited, an Environmental and Social Impact and Risk Management Consulting Firm based in Accra ‚Äì Ghana.
